# Nigeria-2023-Presidential-Elections
Overview of the results of the 2023 presidential elections in Nigeria
The elections were held in February 2023 amid controversies and concerns from both Nigerians and the international community.
This is a vantage point of a citizen, without reference to previous elections, just a single dashboard reflecting citizens' participation in selecting/electing their national leader (President).
This project demonstrates data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization best practices for storytelling with data.

This dashboard explores:
- Voter turnout by geopolitical zone
- Demographic breakdown by age groups
- Party performance

- The goal is to provide clear, actionable insights into voting behaviour and regional participation.
